# Intership Project: Learn To Build A Real Time Gen AI Customer Service Bot

# Task 5: Multilingual Translate Chatbot

## Introduction
This project extends a chatbot to support multiple languages, including English, French, Spanish, German, and Hindi. It aims to automatically detect the user's language, switch seamlessly between languages, and provide culturally appropriate responses. By integrating advanced language processing, this chatbot aims to enhance global communication and accessibility.

## Background
The chatbot addresses the growing demand for multilingual communication in customer service and other applications. Using cutting-edge NLP models like Facebook's M2M100, the system can translate and understand multiple languages. This approach focuses on offering a seamless experience for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds, ensuring effective communication without language barriers.
